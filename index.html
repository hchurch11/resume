                <h2>About My Career Shift</h2>
            </strong>
            <p>
                I am a trained orchestral percussionist and teacher, and the Covid-19 pandemic has left me
                without a
                job. Over the past few years, I have
                entertained
                the
                idea of getting into the tech industry. With my music program being cut, and the prospects
                of
                playing live music soon are low, I've decided to go forward with a career in tech. I hope
                to
                use
                the skills I have learned as a musician and teacher in my new career. I believe my creative
                and
                analytical brain, ability to learn concepts quickly, and my hard work ethic will allow me
                success as
                a Front End Devoloper!
                <br />
            <p>I have been coding since July 2020. I have been teaching myself a lot of material using
                credible
                sources and educational platforms. In addition, I have also taken online course to obtain
                certificates
                in frontend amd React development . To learn more about my work history, education, and what I like to
                do
                for
                fun,
